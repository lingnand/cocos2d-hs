Bindings for cocos2d-x. Note that sources in `cbits` and `src` are generated by the generator program (which itself is compiled from `generator/`).

To use it, first install `hoppy-generator`, `hoppy-std` and `hoppy-runtime` from <https://github.com/khumba/hoppy>.

Then:

```
$ cabal build generator                   # build the binding generator
$ cabal run generator -- --gen-cpp cbits  # generate the c++ side glue code and put it under cbits
$ cabal run generator -- --gen-hs src     # generate the haskell side of code
$ cabal build cocos2d-hs                  # build the generated code into a package
```
